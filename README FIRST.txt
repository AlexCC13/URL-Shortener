This is my solution for the frontend challenge. 

First of all, thank you for the opportunity to participate in it. It was really challenging but also really fun for me.

Some notes regarding my project:

1) I managed to shorten the link and make it appear again at the input box that is already provided and not separately

2)The text that says "link shortened and copied" is missing.

3)I added a second button in order to achieve the "copy to clipboard" functionality. I couldn't understand exactly how I could insert this functionality in the already existing button.

4)Unfortunately, I didn't have more time for styling, I had some ideas but i wanted to prioritize the proper functioning of the website.

Thank you for taking the time to check my project,
Alexis Lagkaditis
